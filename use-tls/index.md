TLS (or SSL) encrypts your connection to the server (in this case IRC server),
making your connection secure against [man-in-the-middle attacks].

We have instructions on how to enable TLS/SSL on a few popular IRC clients:
 - [HexChat](hexchat)
 - [KiwiIRC](kiwiirc)
 - [WeeChat](weechat)
 - [ZNC](znc)

*xeroxIRC does not endorse the usage of any of these clients.*
