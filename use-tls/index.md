TLS (or SSL) encrypts your connection to the server (in this case IRC server),
making your connection secure against [man-in-the-middle attacks].

We have instructions on how to enable TLS/SSL on a few popular IRC clients:
 - [HexChat](/use-tls/hexchat)
 - [KiwiIRC](/use-tls/kiwiirc)
 - [WeeChat](/use-tls/weechat)
 - [ZNC](/use-tls/znc)

*xeroxIRC does not endorse the usage of any of these clients.*
